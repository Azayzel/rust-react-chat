# Rust-React-Chat

A chat app made with Rust and React.

## Set up

First start the server.

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run
```

Then start the front-end app.

```bash
cd frontend && yarn
yarn start
```

Now you can open <http://localhost:3000/> in multiple tabs and try it out.

You can also start both by running

```bash
yarn dev
```
